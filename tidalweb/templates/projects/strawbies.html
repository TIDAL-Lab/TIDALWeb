    <h1 class="title">Strawbies! &mdash; A Tangible Programming Game</h1>
    <p>
      Strawbies is an educational iPad game designed for children ages 5 and up. Players use wooden coding blocks and an <a href="https://www.playosmo.com" target="_blank">Osmo</a> to guide Awbie through a rich and infinitely expanding world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players are free to play the game however they wish. Strawbies' open world is filled with fun and interactive objects that support simple and complex problem solving. Physical coding blocks allow for groups of children to play on an iPad at the same time. Strawbies has been played by children over a wide range of ages and settings.
