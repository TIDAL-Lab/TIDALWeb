  <h1>Build-a-Tree: An Evolution Puzzle Game</h1>
  <p>
    May 25, 2015<br>
    by Michael Horn
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the past few years I've been working with Florian Block, Chia Shen, and the Life on Earth 
    team to create an evolution puzzle game called Build-a-Tree (BAT). This has been a fun and challenging
    project. Fun because I'm really happy with the way BAT turned out. The game debuted as part of a Tree of Life exhibit
    at the California Academy of Sciences, and a web-based version was just featured as part of a PBS NOVA Lab 
    on evolution. We're also working to make BAT into a flexible web-based tool that anyone can use to illustrate
    evolution concepts. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In fact, you can play a version of BAT right here! Just drag the species circles in the green window together to start building a tree...

  But what I want to talk about here are the challenging parts and how our design changed over time as we struggled to find
  the right balance of fun, playability, and value as a learning experience. 
  <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
  As we were putting BAT together, we had a few big-picture
  learning goals in mind. The first is that <b>all life on earth is related</b>. In other words, if you could travel far
  enough back in time, you could find a common, genetic ancestor for just about any two living organisms on the planet. So, just like 
  you and your Aunt Marge share a common ancestor (a grandparent), you and the banana you ate for breakfast also share a distant,
  distant ancestor. Unlike your grandparent, this ancestor was a primoridal Eukariotic organisms that carried genetic information 
  that is still shared by green plants and animals even hundreds of millions of years later.
  </p>
  <p>
  The second big idea that we wanted to get across with the game is that there are <b>key evolutionary landmarks</b> that define 
  major groups of life. These landmarks are shared genetic traits that emerged from processes like natural selection and mutation,
  and allowed organisms to take advantage of new ecological niches. One of my favorite examples is the <i>amniotic egg sac</i> that
  helped the common ancestor of modern-day squamata and mammals to lay eggs away from water and colonize newly available inland 
  habitats. Amphibians don't have this trait, which means that they must return to the water to lay eggs and reproduce. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The last big idea relates to something called <b>tree-thinking skills</b>. One of the most important representations of modern
  biology is called a cladogram or a phylogenetic tree. These diagrams depict hypothesized relationships and traits of organisms,
  genes, or even proteins. Baum, Smith, and Donovan published an influential paper in the journal, Science, arguing that everyone
  should learn basic tree-thinking skills as a matter of basic biology education. These skills relate to being able to read and
  understand trees without <b>mis</b>interpreting their meaning. Common misconceptions include assuming that the left-to-right 
  ordering of a tree is important or that the organisms on the far right is the most <i>evolved</i>. For example, a misunderstanding
  of the tree below is that giraffes are the most complex or evolved species (which is not true), and that butterflies and birds are
  more closely related than birds and giraffes (also not true).
  </p>
  <img src="{% static 'images/blog/bat-figure1.png' %}" style="width: 450px; margin: 0 50px;" alt="a phylgenetic tree showing the relationships of spiders, butterflies, birds, dinosaurs, bats, and giraffes.">
  <p>
  We had lots of other, less important learning goals. For example, lizards and humans are more closely related than than lizards and 
  frogs. But these goals were more like facts and surprising trivia. It was nice if people learned them, but they weren't on the same
  level as our big-picture conceptual goals. 
  </p>

  <h2>Design Principles</h2>
  Our game design was guided by principles of <i>intrinsic integration</i>. This is an idea developed by Yasmin Kafai and then 
  refined by Habgood &amp; Ainsorth in an influential paper in the Journal of the Learning Sciences [CITE]. Intrinsic integration 
  is meant to contrast the <i>extrinsic motivation</i> of the gamification movement.  With gamification you try to use 
  game-like elements and incentives to motivate people to do something that they would otherwise be less interested in. In the 
  case of gamified learning environments, you're not trying to make learning fun as much as you're tying to make it more 
  palatable&mdash;thus Kafai's infamous term "chocolate covered broccoli". Now this is all something of an oversimplification. 
  Research on gamification is more diverse and interesting. Still, when a lot of people and companies and app store marketing jargon
  tells you that they make learning fun, they're talking about chocolate covered broccoli. And it doesn't pass the stink test. 

  http://www.edutopia.org/blog/serious-games-not-chocolate-broccoli-matthew-farber (Matthew Farber)

  A designer integrates the subject matter with the game idea (Kafai 1996)

  This approach hinges upon the ability of learning games to effectively harness the intrinsic motivation (Deci, 1975) of a game for educational goals by creating an intrinsic integration (Kafai, 1996) between a game and its learning content. 

1.  deliver learning material through the parts of the game that are the most fun to play, riding on the back of the flow experience produced by the game, and not interrupting or diminishing its impact and;
2. embody the learning material within the structure of the gaming world and the player's interaction with it, providing an external representation of the learning content that is explored through the core mechanics of the gameplay.

So how is intrinsic integration any different? With intrinsic integration, you're trying to achieve three goals:
1. First and foremost, the game should be fun. This doesn't mean that it has to be easy (in fact quite the opposite), but 
the game shouldn't feel like drudge work or an oblication, or homework (unless your homework happens to be fun). Jim Gee talks about using terms like pleasantly frustraring. and encouraging failure as a learning experience. 

2. The fun parts of the game should be the same as teh learning part. This is what the word <i>integration</i> refers to. You want the best part of the game to be the part where players are engaging with your learning objective. 

3. The game should involve the manipulation of authentic representations.

There was one really important goal for us that was a prioritiy, because we had initially designed BAT as a museum exhibit. That was the importance of the first 30 seconds of the experience. There were a lot of other design principles and ideas that influenced our thinking. If you're interesting in learning more, I've included a few great references at the end of this post (Kafai, stevens, holbert, gee, habgood and ainsworth, squire, steinkeuler).
